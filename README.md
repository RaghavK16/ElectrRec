## Getting Started

Note: Electron Forge requires Node 10 or above, plus git installed.

If you have a more recent version of npm or yarn, you can use npx, or yarn create.

npx create-electron-app my-new-app
```
or
```
yarn create electron-app my-new-app
```
then
```
cd my-new-app
```
```
npm start
```

Alternatively (less recommended):

```
npm install -g @electron-forge/cli
```
```
electron-forge init my-new-app
```
```
cd my-new-app
```
```
npm start
```

## Running the project

npm i && npm start
